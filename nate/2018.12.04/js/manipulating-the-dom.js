// modify documents after they have finished loading- add new content to a page, change the color of an element to reflect a changing state, or remove an element the user does not need anymore.

// interact with your users - whether ticking a box, commenting on a blog post, or submitting a tax form, your users need to be able to communicate with you, and JavaScript allows them to do so;

// send and receive data to and from external API's- harness the power of the thousands of useful API's that already exist or plug your frontend app into your own custom backend.
