// Begin

// Get out the sause pan
// Add some oil
// Pour mince into it
// Cook the mince
// Chop the veggies
// Stir - fry the vbeggies
// Taste - test the veggies
//     if the veggies are good - remove off of the stove
//     if the veggies arent good add salt and pepper and spice
//     if veggies are 


// The first version details all the individual actions that make up the cooking process. The second breaks down the recipe into broader steps and introduces concepts that could be re-used for other dishes as well like cook, stir - fry, add, and roll.

// Our code so far has mimicked the first example (in that it's been very literal), but it's time to start modularizing our example into sub - steps so we can re-use bits and pieces as MSMediaKeyNeededEvent. In JavaScript, these sub - steps are called funtions

// Function
// What are fuctions?

// A function is a group of instructions that performs a particular task.

// function sayHello() {
//     console.log("Hello!");
// }

// console.log("start of program");
// sayHello();
// console.log("end of program");

// Declaring a function

// Creating a funtion is called declaration:

// Declaring a function is myFunction
// function myFunction() {
//     Function actions
// }

var name = prompt("Enter your name");

function greetingUser() {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greetingUser();
